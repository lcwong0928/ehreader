emrQA is a semi-automatically generated large-scale question answering dataset on clinical notes available across several i2b2 challlenges (until 2014).  

The list of datasets used in generating emrQA are as follows:  i2b2 relations (concepts, relations, assertions), i2b2 medications, i2b2 heart disease risk, i2b2 smoking, i2b2 obesity.

A detailed readme (https://github.com/emrQA/emrQA/blob/master/README.md) and the used scripts for generating the dataset from the i2b2 datasets is available on our git repository (https://github.com/emrQA/emrQA). The question and logical form templates used in generating emrQA are also hosted on the git (https://github.com/emrQA/emrQA/blob/master/templates/templates-all.csv)

The dataset folder here was generated by running the scripts in the above git repository. You can access the complete emrQA dataset as data.json and question-logical form data as data-ql.csv. We also generate intermediate datasets for every i2b2 challenge (e.g. medications-qa.json and medication-ql.csv generated from the 2009 medications challenge annotations). the format of the json files is described here: https://github.com/emrQA/emrQA/blob/master/README.md

The entire process for generating the dataset has been published in the following EMNLP 2018 paper:

Anusri Pampari, Preethi Raghavan, Jennifer Liang and Jian Peng, emrQA: A Large Corpus for Question Answering on Electronic Medical Records,
In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2018, Brussels, Belgium.


We will shortly also update the repository with some standard train/dev/test splits.
